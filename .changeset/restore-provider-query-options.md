Restore per-provider react-query configuration and the organization prefetch prop, matching the old ui-components API. `ElectionProvider` accepts `queryOptions` (the election read) and `resultsQueryOptions` (the results read — e.g. `refetchInterval` for live tallies); `OrganizationProvider` accepts `queryOptions` and an `organization` prop for prefetched data (seeded as `initialData`, with `id` derived from `organization.address` when omitted). As in the old API, `queryKey`/`queryFn`/`enabled`/`initialData` stay provider-owned. `OrganizationProvider`'s fetch prop is `id` (the org address), and `organizationQueryKeys` is exported for cache pre-seeding/invalidation, mirroring `electionQueryKeys`.
