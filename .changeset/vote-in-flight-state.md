Expose the vote-in-flight state. `useElection()` gains `voting: boolean`, true exactly while a `vote()` call runs — from entry until it settles, on both success and error — for "processing your vote" overlays. `<VoteButton />` now disables itself and reports `loading` while a vote is in flight, closing the double-submit window (previously it stayed clickable with `loading` hardcoded to `false`).
