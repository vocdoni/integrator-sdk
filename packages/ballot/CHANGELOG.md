# @vocdoni/ballot

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 242f6f0: Promote `@vocdoni/ballot` and `@vocdoni/api-voting` to 1.0.0.

  No API changes in either package — this is a versioning fix.

  While they sat on `0.x`, every additive change forced a **major** on the React
  packages. `^0.1.2` means `>=0.1.2 <0.2.0`, so a minor (`0.1.2` → `0.2.0`) is
  _out of range_ for a caret dependent and gets majored. That defeats the
  `onlyUpdatePeerDependentsWhenOutOfRange` fix, which only helps when the bump is
  genuinely in range — and for a `0.x` package a minor never is. The practical
  effect was that adding an export to `@vocdoni/ballot` had to ship as a `patch`
  just to avoid gratuitously majoring `@vocdoni/react-components`.

  At `1.x`, `^1.0.0` covers every later minor, so additive changes cascade as
  patches and can be declared honestly.

  The React packages take only a **patch**: their peer ranges on these two
  packages widen from `workspace:^` to `workspace:>=0.1.2 <2`, which spans both
  the old and new majors. That is accurate rather than a workaround — 1.0.0
  changes no API, so `react-components` really does work with both. Consumers on
  `@vocdoni/react-components@^2` keep working with no range change.

### Minor Changes

- e7a7dae: Stop creating multichoice elections whose votes are silently discarded at tally.

  The backend derives the **dense** layout for `type: 'multichoice'` (one 0/1 field per
  choice, `maxTotalCost = typeSetup.maxChoices`) while also mapping
  `typeSetup.uniqueChoices` onto the on-chain `voteMode.uniqueValues`. The scrutinizer
  applies `uniqueValues` to the raw field values, so a 0/1 vector over more than two
  choices always repeats one — even a single pick, `[1, 0, 0, 0]`, repeats `0`. Every
  ballot was rejected during aggregation while the vote still counted towards
  `voteCount`, producing elections that reported an all-zero tally with
  `finalResults: true`.

  - `@vocdoni/api-client`: `elections.create` / `elections.update` now reject
    `typeSetup.uniqueChoices` on `multichoice` questions, and reject a raw
    `ballotProtocol` that is unsatisfiable, instead of publishing an election that cannot
    be tallied. Both checks mirror what the API itself enforces, so this fails fast and
    locally without masking the server's answer — a ranked ballot is expressed as a raw
    `ballotProtocol` instead. Adds `@vocdoni/ballot` as a dependency.
  - `@vocdoni/ballot`: new `unsatisfiableProtocolReason`, `unsatisfiableQuestionReason`,
    `isUnsatisfiableProtocol`, `isUnsatisfiableQuestion`, `voteTypeBounds`,
    `assertEncodedBallot` and the `ProtocolBounds` type, plus `isDenseBallotProtocol` is
    now exported. `encodeBallot`, `encodeQuestionBallot` and `validateSelections` throw
    on an unsatisfiable config rather than encoding a ballot that will never count.
    `unsatisfiableQuestionReason` works off `type` + `typeSetup` too, so a UI can flag an
    already-created broken question from a public read (which omits the derived protocol).

    The guard covers the _product_ as well as the config: both encoders now run
    `assertEncodedBallot` on every ballot they build and throw when a field exceeds
    `maxValue` or repeats a value the protocol requires unique (duplicate ranks on a
    ranked ballot, both picks of a two-field dense unique layout, an out-of-range
    single-choice value) — a satisfiable config still admits ballots the chain accepts,
    counts in `voteCount`, and silently drops during aggregation, and a vote must either
    count or fail loudly. `validateSelections` mirrors the same rules on raw selections
    (duplicate unique picks, repeated amounts on a legacy unique budget shape), and
    `unsatisfiableProtocolReason` returns `null` on malformed bounds instead of a
    NaN-laden reason.

  - `@vocdoni/api-types`: documents the constraint on `BallotProtocol.uniqueValues` and
    `QuestionTypeSetup.uniqueChoices`.
  - `@vocdoni/react-components`: the vote form catches these encode-time rejections and
    marks the offending question invalid instead of letting them escape `handleSubmit`
    as an unhandled promise rejection on an already-broken election.

  Already-published elections with this config cannot be repaired — their votes are on
  chain but were never aggregated. The derivation bug itself is upstream
  (vocdoni/saas-backend#619), so processes created outside this SDK are still affected.

### Patch Changes

- e7a7dae: Fix budget / quadratic results decoding, which returned **0 for every option** on
  every budget and quadratic election. Found while extending the integration suite to
  vote every supported ballot type — the same silent all-zero symptom as the
  multichoice `uniqueChoices` bug, with an unrelated cause.

  `maxValue === 0` does not just mark budget/quadratic — it switches the scrutinizer to
  _discrete aggregation_: it accumulates `Σ amount × weight` into column 0 of each
  option's row and leaves the row one cell wide, rather than building a histogram.
  `decodeResults` / `decodeQuestionResults` index-weighted that row (`Σ value × count`),
  which reads the sole column at index 0 and therefore always produced zero. They now
  read the aggregated cell.

  Verified live: a 4-option budget question where 3 voters each allocated `[4, 0, 6, 0]`
  returns `[["12"],["0"],["18"],["0"]]` on chain and now decodes to `[12, 0, 18, 0]`
  instead of `[0, 0, 0, 0]`.

### Patch Changes

- aaa4765: Fix the codec for backend-derived (named-type) multichoice questions. The backend derives a dense layout for `type: 'multichoice'` — one 0/1 ballot field per choice (`maxCount = numChoices`, `maxValue = 1`), with `maxTotalCost` bounding the number of picks — but the codec routed `uniqueValues: true` protocols to the legacy pick-slot layout, producing ballots the chain silently discards at tally and misreading the dense results histogram.

  - `maxValue === 1` now always selects the dense wire layout (a pick-slot layout needs `maxValue >= numChoices - 1`, so `maxValue === 1` can only be dense): `encodeQuestionBallot` emits the 0/1 vector (capped at `maxTotalCost` picks) and `decodeQuestionResults` reads the per-choice `[notSelected, selected]` rows.
  - `inferQuestionBallotType` keeps the `MultiChoice` label for named multichoice questions (badges, tips and pick caps stay multichoice-flavoured) and returns `Approval` for any other `maxValue === 1` protocol — including `uniqueValues: true`, which previously fell through to pick-slot. `inferBallotType` (election-level) likewise drops the `!uniqueChoices` guard.
  - `questionSelectionRange` understands the dense layout: `max` is `maxTotalCost` (falling back to the number of choices), `min` comes from `typeSetup.minChoices`, since `maxCount` is the choice count there, not the pick bound.

  Note: elections whose on-chain protocol combines the dense layout with `uniqueChoices: true` are unsatisfiable at the scrutinizer (uniqueness applies to raw 0/1 field values) — that needs a saas-backend fix; no client-side encoding can produce a valid multi-pick ballot for them.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 0b4c33b: Confirmed-review fixes across the per-question model surface.

  **`@vocdoni/api-client` (breaking):**

  - `elections.update()` now resolves `void` — the backend answers a bare
    `200 OK` with no body, so the previous `Promise<string>` never carried the
    process id it claimed to. Re-`get()` the process if you need the updated shape.
  - `elections.delete()` now targets the new-model `DELETE /processes/{id}` route.
  - `elections.signInfo()` migrated to `POST /processes/{id}/sign-info` and now
    returns the per-question `ProcessSignInfoResponse` (`{ consumed: [...] }`)
    instead of the legacy single-election `ConsumedAddressResponse`.
  - `setStatus()`/`setStatusAndWait()` and `getMetadata()` are documented as
    legacy-only (single-election model, vochain ids); new-model lifecycle goes
    through `setQuestionStatus()`/`bulkSetQuestionStatus()`.
  - Fix: the client's response parser no longer throws `SyntaxError` on the bare
    `200 OK` (`"\n"`) bodies the backend writes for update/delete/status
    endpoints — blank bodies now resolve as empty instead of failing JSON.parse.

  **`@vocdoni/api-types`:** new `ProcessSignInfoResponse` /
  `QuestionConsumedAddress` types; `QuestionStatusID` JSDoc corrected (it is the
  per-question entry of `SetQuestionsStatusRequest`, not a request body).

  **`@vocdoni/ballot`:** the per-question helpers no longer guess.
  `inferQuestionBallotType()` falls back to the named question `type`
  (`singlechoice`/`multichoice`) when `ballotProtocol` is missing and throws
  instead of silently assuming single-choice; `encodeQuestionBallot()` throws on
  more than one selection for single-choice questions (previously extras were
  silently dropped) and on multichoice questions lacking a `ballotProtocol`.

- 2a0cbed: Migrate from monolithic `Election` to `VotingProcessResponse` with per-question model.

  **Breaking changes:**

  - `@vocdoni/api-types`: Introduces `VotingProcessResponse`, `VotingProcessQuestion`, `BallotProtocol`, `QuestionStatus`, and `VotingProcessResultsResponse`. The old `Election` type is removed.
  - `@vocdoni/api-client`: `elections.get()` now returns `VotingProcessResponse` (hits `GET /processes/{id}`). New `elections.getResults()` method (`GET /processes/{id}/results`). Exports `computeProcessStatus(questions)` which derives a top-level `QuestionStatus` from all question statuses.

  **New features:**

  - `@vocdoni/ballot`: New exports `inferQuestionBallotType`, `encodeQuestionBallot`, `decodeQuestionResults`, `questionReservesAbstain`, `questionSelectionRange` — per-question ballot helpers based on `BallotProtocol`.

  (The react-providers/react-components side of this migration is tracked in a
  separate changeset, held back until the React packages release.)

## 0.0.1

### Patch Changes

- Initial release of `@vocdoni/ballot` — a framework-agnostic package for Vocdoni ballot semantics.

  Exports:

  - `inferBallotType(election)` — classify an election (`single-choice` / `multichoice` / `approval` / `budget` / `quadratic`); replaces the old-SDK `instanceof PublishedElection` check.
  - `encodeBallot(election, selections)` — build the on-chain `choices` vector from high-level selections. Accepts a flat `number[]` or a nested `number[][]` (one array per question). Handles approval dense 0/1 vectors and multichoice abstain padding.
  - `decodeResults(election)` — turn the raw results histogram into per-question / per-choice tallies with percentages, unifying multichoice abstain sentinels into a single bucket.
  - `validateSelections(election, selections)` — basic pre-cast validation of selections against ballot config.
  - `multichoiceReservesAbstain(election)` — whether a multichoice election reserves enough `maxValue` room to abstain-pad a partial selection (useful for UI validation).
  - `BallotType` — runtime const and matching type.
